# Image Renaming Tool

Renaming images in Windows is easy enabling the 'Preview Pane' inside the
Windows Explorer. However, it can sometimes be difficult since some images are
displayed too small. Additionally, having all the files easily visible
overwhelms me whenever I need to rename too many files. In addition, Windows
automatically sorts the images once renamed, which is inconvenient when I want
to keep sequence intact.

These three problems led me to practice my Python skills and make an image
renaming tool: a tool where the image displayed is as big as the computer screen
height (and can even be in full-screen for total immersion), I only see one
image at a time, and images are renamed in place, keeping the original order
until program is closed.

User interface can be improved, tho ...
